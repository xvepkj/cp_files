Approach:- 
We will keep the price of edge the destination vertex and the length(this is basically the amount of  change in fuel as the 1 length requires 1 unit of fuel.)
  Now to do "Lazy deletion(refer in book if forgotten)" we will use dp type approach-memo[fuel    
    capacity][edge]
Initially we will set price of each edge as 0 and if we buy a unit of fuel at u we will add price[u] to price of edge and Enqueue it.
 We will only enqueue the vertices in adj list if they need less or equal fuel than we have to get to them.
 if(e is reached)result price=the price that comes with e.
